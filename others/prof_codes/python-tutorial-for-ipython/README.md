(C) 2016-2018 by [Damir Cavar]

See the licensing details on the individual documents and in the [LICENSE] file in the code folder.

The files in this folder are Jupyter-based tutorials for NLP, ML, AI in Python for classes I teach in Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the [Computational Linguistics Program] in the [Department of Linguistics] at [Indiana University].

If you find this material useful, please cite the author and source (that is [Damir Cavar]). Please let me know, if you have some suggestions to correct the notebooks, improve them, add some material.


## Introduction

To run this material in [Jupyter] you need to have Python 3.x and [Jupyter] installed. You can save yourself some trouble by using the [Anaconda Python 3.x distribution].

Clone the project folder using:

	git clone https://github.com/dcavar/python-tutorial-for-ipython.git

To start the [Jupyter] notebook viewer/editor on your local machine change into the *notebooks* folder within the cloned project folder and run the following command:

	jupyter notebook

A browser window should open up that allows you full access to the notebooks.

Enjoy!
